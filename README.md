# 50+ SwiftUI Open Source Projects With Guided Tutorials

A collection of SwiftUI projects published on [Better Programming](https://betterprogramming.pub/).

SwiftUI, Apple’s declarative UI framework was released in 2019 and has only gotten better from there.

Below, we’ve compiled some of the best SwiftUI open-source projects and guides created by Better Programming authors. I hope it inspires you to build more stuff using this amazing framework.

## 1. [3D Bar Charts](https://betterprogramming.pub/build-a-3d-bar-chart-in-scenekit-with-swiftui-789a2631ef6f)

We all love implementing charts in our SwiftUI apps. To our respite, Apple now has a Charts framework to quickly populate any type of chart.

But ever wondered how to build it in 3D? Go no further, as [Mark](https://marklucking.medium.com/) shows us how to build it using SceneKit and SwiftUI in this [repository](https://bitbucket.org/wizard1066/bars/src/master/). You can also check out, [the companion tutorial](https://betterprogramming.pub/build-a-3d-bar-chart-in-scenekit-with-swiftui-789a2631ef6f) for it.

## 2. [Pie Charts](https://betterprogramming.pub/build-pie-charts-in-swiftui-822651fbf3f2)

With the new Charts framework, we have the ability to create line, area, rule, point charts as well, but the Pie charts component is still missing. Gladly, we needn’t reinvent the wheel as [Nazar Ilamanov](https://ilamanov.medium.com/)’s [GitHub project](https://github.com/ilamanov/SwiftPieChart) shows how to build and customize pie charts.
